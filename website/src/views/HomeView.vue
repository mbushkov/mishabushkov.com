      <h1>«the black rat has died»</h1>
      <h2 class="pico-color-red-400">New photobook, ready to pre-order!</h2>
    </hgroup>
    <p>«the black rat has died» is a raw, bittersweet, and at times darkly ironic book about life, death, and family.
      Misha Bushkov interweaves intimate scenes of his wife’s pregnancy in Switzerland with pictures of his extended
      family 3,000 kilometers away in Russia. These images — made before the invasion of Ukraine — capture a world
      Bushkov now feels has irrevocably changed. Through cinematic sequencing and two deeply personal letters written
      after the birth of his son, Bushkov fuses tenderness, absurdity, and contradiction, capturing the dissonance of
      what it means to be a family across distance, borders, and time.</p>
